         In this problem, you need to be a Java Detective!  You have been given the entire Start class.  However, all of the rest of the code is missing.  Your job is to look for clues in the code to help you to write all of the other code to make this code work and give you an output similar to below:
        
          Here is a sample output:
            Name: Bart
            Height: 1.3
            LuckyNumber: 7
        
             Name: Lisa
            Height: 1.1
            LuckyNumber: 4
        ⁡
            OK, now we need to make the code below work.  Note that a lucky number should always be positive and a height should never be negative.  Go ahead and uncomment the code below and get it working!  
            
        */

        // Person p1 = new Person();

        // p1.setName(Utils.getStringInput("Enter name of first person"));  //uh oh...need a Utils class!

        // p1.setLuckyNumber(Utils.getIntInput("Enter luckyNumber of first person"));

        // p1.setHeightInMeters(Utils.getDoubleInput("Enter height of first person"));

        // Person p2 = new Person("Bart",6,1.3);

        // System.out.println(p1.getDescription());

        // System.out.println(p2.getDescription());

    }
}
