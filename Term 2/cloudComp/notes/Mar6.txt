Elastic: As you need the ipv4 address you grab it but once you do it is permenant
AWS used to charge you for not using (idle) ips, now they charge you no matter what
VPC Peering: VPC to talk to another VPC, AWS sends you over the internet. but for VPC peering it keeps it hidden, AWS does that. Not free and not automatic

VPC starts with a default 172.31.0.0/16

Last address in a block is called broadcast, the host can ping all the addresses and they only pay for this once
Subnetting controls the amount of broadcasts, just like sheridan has only 30 students per class so they are controlable
Second VPC created needs an internet gateway to manually be created and connected

Subnet addresses does not define if they are private or not
The first host address belongs to vpc the next belongs to DNS service


FOR TEST 2:

REVIEW QUIZ 3 - Reuses questions

MEMORIZE: IPv4 ranges
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

22 SSH
53 DNS
80 HTTP
443 HTTPS

VPC vs Subnet: Create 1 subnet as big VPC but usesless, VPC creates and holds everything and subnet is something hold inside VPC


CONTINUE WITH LESSON 7:
Know these steps for TEST 2
Public key: can be given to anyone
Private key: never give up (admin uses)
They are both linked mathematically
Eg.
Public: Candy
Private: Credit card used to buy candy
Public key can decrypt only if private key that is linked is the one who encrypted it
