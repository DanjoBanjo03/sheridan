Dan Zen-
We also mentioned that I wanted you to know the main screen reader for Windows, Mac and Android - 
these are Narrator, VoiceOver and TalkBalk.  
Also, you are to know the Media Query code that acts like a conditional to find the screen size, 
and the code for the simple examples of FlexBox and Grid. 

HTML 5 TAGS
Semantic - 'Meaning', Instead of using division tags it uses tags to describe the items.
ROBOTS and new HTML 5 OUTLINERS help determine the content
HTML 5 is JavaScript broken up into JavaScript and APIs. Including DOM (Document Object Model) - how tags are accessed.

<aside> - supporting details
<details> - extra info to be read
<summary> - a summary for title tag only
<mark> - for highlighted text
<time> - show date and time

SERVER DETAILS
Most common server - Apache on Linux
NodeJS is similar by providing express for the DIY industry
FTP - file transfer protocol, fileZilla
Permissions - Read, Write and execute
755 is used so that owner can edit but no one else

Responsive & Adaptive Design
Responsive - when the screen scales or wraps to fit the size of the screen (%, em, vw, etc)
Adaptive - Stuff comes in and removes as you shrink or enlarge the size of the screen (media queries)

@media all and (max-width: 640px){
write stuff for screen sizes less than 640 pixels (phones)
}

@media all and (min-width: 641px){
write stuff for screen sizes larger than 641 pixels
}

display: flex;
flex-flow:row wrap;
gap: 20px;

display: grid;
grid-template-column: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
gap: 20px;
