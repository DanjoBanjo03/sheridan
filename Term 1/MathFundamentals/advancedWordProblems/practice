A = 2B
A = C - 10
C = A + 10
C = 2B + 10

A + B + C = 160
2B + B + 2B + 10 = 160
5B = 150
B = 30
A = 2*30 = 60
C = 60 + 10 = 70

12 processors 5 min for 6 solutions
40 = 2 groups, 1st group has 4 more processors than 2nd group
how long for second group to compute 27 solutions

A+B =40
B+4 = A
B+4+B = 40
2B = 36
B = 18
A = 22

12 processors in 1 min = 6/5

1 processor in 1 min = 6/5/12 = 6/60 = 1/10 solution/min

18(1/10) * t = 27
(18/10)t = 27
18t = 270
t = 270/18
t = 15 min
