Routing: Finding the best (depends on the criteriea) path to every destination

RIP: Use hop (# of routers you pass through) count (fewest # of hops) - this does not take into account fastest path, bus 1 which has 1 transfer but 50 min or bus 2, no transfers but 3 hours. RIP will go bus 2 less transfers.

Dijkstra's algorithm <---OSPF--->>>VVVV<----EIGRP ---> cisco routers only (u can buy windows for apple but not apple for windows)
							Calculate a path
							weight based on a
							throughput bandwith,
							latency to generate
							a path weight

Forwarding: using data from routing to actually send the message
* routing table is the same thing as the forwarding table*

default routing: 0.0.0.0/0
-> sends all traffic one way
-> often used as a catch all for routing

DHCP
Automatically assigns an IP when a PC join a network

1. PC makes a DHCP broadcast request for an IP
2. All DHCP servers will offer 1 available IP - those IP's are now reserved
3. The PC will accept the first IP it recieves
4. PC broadcasts its new IP. Any unused IP's are now free to use

Private (10,172,192)
-> free
-> no internet access
-> ipconfig

NAT
-> Maps private IP to piblic

Benefits
1. Security
2. saves on IP's
-> devices live printers dont need public IP's
-> share 1 public IP for multiple users

Public
-> pay
-> Internet Access
-> google
