Hub - Sends to all

Bridge - remembers all locations and sends only if it knows the location of the destination

Switch - Sends to all if they dont know where, and stores location. Then if someone tries to send to already saved location itll send directly, no send to all.

Routers - Work using IP addresses, routing protocol: has routers share their routing info. Default routing: we use 0.0.0.0/0 to represent any destination (send all traffic out an interface)
